## Amihan-Interview
My submission for Amihan's Interview Exam.

# Hi! Below are the overviews to the coding challenges.

## Problem Set 1
Palidrome Pairs

The problem requires me to concatenate two distinct values/strings in a list and check if the pair is a palindrome. The expected output is a list of index pairs which are palindromes.

## Problem Set 2
Valid Parentheses

The second problem set requires me to check an input of brackets, parentheses, and braces and output true if the pairs are closed properly and false if not.

## Problem Set 3
Longest Increasing Subsequence

The last problem is about taking the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an array of numbers. Basically, you want to get an output of the length of the LIS.
